/*
2.Define a class called Odometer that will be used to track fuel and mileage for an automobile. 
The class should have instance variables to track the miles driven and the fuel efficiency of the vehicle in miles per gallon. 
Include a setter method to reset the odometer to zero miles, a setter method to set the fuel efficiency, a setter method that accepts 
miles driven for a trip and adds it to the odometerâ€™s total, and an getter method that returns the number of gallons of gasoline that the vehicle has 
consumed since the odometer was last reset.
Write a driver class with several trips with different fuel efficiencies. You should decide which variables should be public, if any.
